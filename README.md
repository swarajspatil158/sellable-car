## Car Price Prediction Web App
## Problem Statement
### 
The prices of new cars in the industry is fixed by the manufacturer with some additional costs incurred
by the Government in the form of taxes. So, customers buying a new car can be assured of the money
they invest to be worthy. But due to the increased price of new cars and the incapability of customers to
buy new cars due to the lack of funds, used cars sales are on a global increase (Pal, Arora and Palakurthy,
2018). There is a need for a used car price prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of
the car using a variety of features. Even though there are websites that offer this service, their prediction
method may not be the best. Besides, different models and systems may contribute to predicting power
for a used carâ€™s actual market value. It is important to know their actual market value while both buying
and selling.
Therefore, we decided to make Car Price Prediction app to meet the following objectives:
- To predict the selling price of an old car on the basis of car data from websites.
- To save lot of time required for checking and verifying worth of car
- To provide clean, beautiful, easy and interactive web app for better user experience
